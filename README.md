# Food-Delivery-Analysis

## Introduction

Revolutionizing Grubhub with Data 🍔📊 | Crafting interactive dashboards and predictive HTML recommendation models to elevate food delivery experiences. 📈🚀 #GrubhubAnalysis #FoodTechInnovation.

## Problem Statement
- Extract data from GRUBHUB using Python libraries like Selienium.
- Parse and clean the data, ensuring consistency and handling missing values.
- For dynamic dashboard used Power Bi with the following insights:
   - Area-wise  Distribution of Restaurants.
   - Top 3 location Having most DRN of the Restaurants.
   - Most Cheapest Restaurants Based On Cuisines.
   - Create slicers to assess case severity in different locations and Restaurants.
   - Maximum Restaurants By Each Location. 
- Build HTML Recommandation Model.

## 📊 Project Overview

- **Objective**: Develop a recommendation model for restaurant in NewYork City.
- **Data Source**: Scrape data from Grubhub using Python.
- **Libraries Used**: NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib.
- **Recommendation Model**: Predict preferred price and suggest a suitable location based on cuisine and price.

## 🌟 Tech Stack
- **Python:** Data extraction and EDA
- **Power Query:** Minor data adjustments
- **Power Bi:** Dashboard creation and data presentation
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Used Jupyter as IDE
- **Algorithm Complexity**: Developing a recommendation algorithm that considers multiple factors while ensuring scalability and real-time performance was challenging.
- **User Engagement**: Encouraging users to engage with the recommendation system and provide feedback for continuous improvement.

<br>

## 💡 Insights Derived

- **Personalized Recommendations**: The recommendation model provides personalized restaurant suggestions based on user preferences, determines the best location for opening a restaurant.

- **User Engagement**: Analyzing user interactions with recommended restaurants and tracking user feedback helps refine the recommendation algorithm.

- **Restaurant Insights**: By analyzing user preferences, restaurant owners can gain insights into customer preferences, leading to menu optimization and targeted promotions.

<br>

## 🚀 Future Scope

- **User Feedback Loop**: Implement a feedback mechanism to capture user preferences and continuously update the recommendation model.

- **Geo-Location Integration**: Integrate real-time location data to recommend nearby restaurants and delivery options

- **Market Expansion**: Extend the recommendation system to other cities and regions to reach a broader user base.
